# Recreation-of-PacMan-by-Ben-Buzzelli
A recreation of PacMan from scratch, using the original ghost logic.

This was my first real project when I was new to coding, so please excuse some
of my bad practices lol.
---------------------------
To draw the ghost's individual target squares, uncomment line 167 in `PacManBoard.java`

```//			g.drawImage(ghost.targetSquare, ghost.updateTargetSquare()[0] + xplus, ghost.updateTargetSquare()[1] + yplus, width / 4, height / 4, this);```
